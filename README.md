# Encoding Guard for Java

Prevents accidental encoding conversions of Java source code by making it
uncompilable if the encoding is changed.

Requires that the expected encoding of the source code is hard coded into your
build script.

The current encoding of the source code is UTF-8.

Test it out as follows:

    ant compile

Yields `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.

Now convert the .java files encoding and try to compile (requires `iconv` on
your path):

    ant -DfromEncoding=UTF-8 -DtoEncoding=ISO-8859-15 switch-encoding
    ant compile

Yields `BUILD FAILED`.

## How it works

The compilation failure for the wrong encoding is provided by utilizing Java's
requirement that all case statements within a switch statement must be unique:

    // The Euro sign has different byte representation in UTF-8, ISO-8859-15
    // and CP-1252. The encoding of this file should be UTF-8.
    switch (0x20AC) { // Euro, UTF-8
        case 'â‚¬': break; // Euro in the encoding of this file
        case 0xA4: break; // Euro, ISO-8859-15
        case 0x80: break; // Euro, CP-1252
    }
